#+begin_src bash :tangle loadModules.sh

# enter your version hash after '/'
# the same you'll have to do for every packages you want to load
# general syntax : spack load package_name/package-hash

#+end_src

* Shavak loading packages
- I created a file ~loadModules~ located in the root folder of this repo.
- ~loadModules~ is the script to load your modules after login to your shavak.
- To run that file save it in your home folder (or at your desired location) and type the below command in terminal.
#+begin_src bash
. path_to_your_loadModules.sh
# if you saved your file in your home folder then type
. ~/loadModules.sh
#+end_src
- Remember if your spack is not working or giving errors then do the following fixes.
  + First check if you are working in conda environment or not.
  + (base) will be showing in the beginning of your shell prompt.
  + Now deactivate the conda environment using command: ~conda deactivate~.
  + After typing above command (base) will deactivate.
  + Now relogin to your shavak and follow the above steps to load Modules.
